after my learning basic of react and redux  my friend suggested me to do a clone of existing library react-date-range. 
2 month have passed since i stared  learning html and there is my first project that i have wrote totally on my own.  i know that a lot of thing are not right but i also know that everything will come with practice and knowledge. so i continue learning react and other libraries that are needed to be a react.js developer and i think my next own project will be much better :)
